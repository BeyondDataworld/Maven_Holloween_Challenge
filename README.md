# Maven_Holloween_Challenge
Based on the given dataset of more than 290,000 matchups made of 85 different candy bars, using an analytical process the top 3 candy bars for this year Holloween is selected.
I used Pandas library of python to calculate the composite score by applying weights to the candy bar in the following:

- Win percent is given a weightage of (50%) based on consumer preferences.

- Sugar percent is given a weightage of (-30%) based on less sugar, giving importance to health.

- Price percent is given a weightage of (-20%) assuming less price is favorable.

The analysis gave the composite score which allowed the following candies to be ranked as top 3:
- Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
- Reese Miniatures
- Twix
- 
The dashboard is made using the Dash library and the visuals used are created from Plotly library of Python.
